# Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

## Problem Description

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.


## Example

### Example 1:

```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
```
*The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.*


### Example 2:

```
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
```
*Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.*
